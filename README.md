#About
Hi, I'm David! I have a technical background and am a former member of the Nuclear US Navy. I have 10 years in electrical and power distribution systems with 6 of those years being in Naval Nuclear Power.
I have always been a analytical person and was recently given the opportunity to participate in a boot camp for Data Analytics.

During my studies, I dedicated myself to mastering my craft at working with complex data and further sharpened my attention to detail for identify patterns and trends. I also gained invaluable excperience with staistical analysis and data visualizations.
