# About Me & My Journey
Hi, I'm David, a data analyst with a strong technical background and a passion for uncovering insights from complex data sets. Combining 10 years of experience in electrical and power distribution systems, including 6 years in the rigorous environment of Naval Nuclear Power, I recently discovered a new calling through an opportunity from my employer in a data analytics boot camp. What started as a curious exploration transformed into a deep fascination with the potential of data to unveil hidden patterns and empower informed decision-making.

Driven by this newfound passion, I have dedicated myself to mastering data analysis techniques. During the boot camp and beyond, I sharpened my critical thinking and attention to detail, enabling me to effectively identify trends and patterns. Simultaneously, I acquired valuable expertise in statistical analysis, financial analysis, and data visualization, solidifying my proficiency in a diverse range of analytical tools.

This repository showcases my skills and experience through carefully curated projects, each highlighting specific capabilities. You'll find projects demonstrating my strengths in data exploration, statistical analysis, financial analysis, data visualization, and more. Notably, a majority of these projects leverage Python programming languages within the Jupyter Notebook environment.
