#About
Hi, I'm David! I have a technical background and am a former member of the Nuclear US Navy. I have a combined 10 years in electrical and power distribution systems with 6 of those years being in Naval Nuclear Power. I have always been a analytical person and was recently given the opportunity through my employer to participate in a boot camp for Data Analytics. What began as a simple application out of curiosity, blossomed into a full blown passion for data and the endless possibilities!

During my studies, I dedicated myself to mastering my craft at working with complex datasets and further sharpened my attention to detail for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained invaluable excperience with statistical analysis, financial analysis and data visualization.

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folder that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data exploration, statistical analysis, financial analysis, data visualization, etc. A majority of the projects are done using python programming language in Jupyter Notebook.
